## 💡 Considerations

There are some consideations when we build and digitalize the new process:

- error handlign in the process (e.g. implement one of the patterns, such as the Saga pattern)
- service tasks:
    - are they synchronus or asynchronous
    - are they message producers or consumers
    - what data is exchanged
- how do we trigger a new process instance (e.g. via a ```POST``` on the Camiunda REST API)
- how do we glue different services together? (MAKE.com as middleware, self-scripted middleware)
