## 💡 Considerations

There are some consideations when we build and digitalize the new process:

- error handling in the process
    - what error handling pattern to use
    - interrupting vs. non-interrupting error events
    - at least 1 error scenario should be covered (and we can elaborate in the paper further)
- service tasks:
    - are they synchronus or asynchronous
    - are they message producers or consumers
    - what data is exchanged
    - webhook, REST API call, messaging, ...
- how do we trigger a new process instance (e.g. via a ```POST``` on the Camiunda REST API)
- how do we glue different services together? (MAKE.com as middleware, self-scripted middleware)
- how does the customer interact with the process, e.g. a chatbot or UI
