## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

### Process Model

1. The process model is deployed on Camunda Platform 
1. The Digisailor HR Buddy is a self-service web platform for the Hiring Manager, HR Staff and the Applicants:
    - The app is accessed via [https://digisailors.ch/](https://digisailors.ch/)
    - Hiring Manager and HR Staff need to login (Password: ```secret```) 
    - A new process instances is created via Camunda REST Engine API as soon as the hiring manager enter a new position title:
        - The logic is in [./app/frontend/server-middleware/camunda/api.js](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Bananas/blob/main/app/frontend/server-middleware/camunda/api.js)
        - A business key is created for each position using current year, month and the slug of the position title
    - Once the process instance is created the process starts, i.e., the token is moved to the first task ```generate_job_ad```
    - The first task ```generate_job_ad``` is waiting for message via topic brokerage
    - The Hiring Manager continues in the HR Buddy App by enter key skills for the position, which are fed into the OpenAI API to auto-generate a job ad text via GPT-4
    - The Hiring Manager can edit the generated job ad until satisfied. When confirming the job ad, this will fetch the external service task ```job_ad``` for given process instance from the Camdunda REST API, lock the external task, and mark it as completed. 
    - As soon as the job ad is defined, HR employees check whether there are suitable internal candidates. This check is based on vector similarity search in Weviate, where it compares document embeddings of the job ad with embeddings of employee's biographies.
    - If potential internal candidates are available: the user task will be started by HR employees reaching out to these candidates to evaluate whether they should be considered for the open position, if there are no interested employees, the process goes on to advertise the position job ad on social media. 
    - If there are no potential candidates available: the position job ad is being published and advertised fully automated, simulated by pushing to Mastodon social media (open source alternative to Twitter) and realized via automated polling via the node worker app and the process is waiting for applicants.
    - Each application is a separate process. 
    - The process waits to receive the message whether a candiate should be considered for the shortlist.
    
    - üî¥ **TODO** to be continued... save business data to Google Sheet, publish job ad text to the topic exchange üî¥


### Profiles of the internal candidates and questions for the precheck

Here are a few pre-screening questions that we can use for the precheck (Gezim):
1. Can you confirm your eligibility to work in [country/region]?
2. Are you comfortable with the salary range provided in the job description?
3. Are you available to work the required hours/schedule for this position?
4. Are you willing to undergo a background check and/or drug test if required?
5. Do you have any upcoming commitments or planned absences that may impact your ability to start working within the next [timeframe]?

These questions can help the company gather essential information about each applicant's qualifications and compatibility with the job requirements. It can also help to narrow down the candidate pool before conducting in-depth interviews.

### API Interfaces

#### Camunda REST Engine

The Camunda REST Engine API is used to create a new process instance and handle external tasks (fetch external task for process instance, lock and mark as completed).

The implementation is in [./app/frontend/server-middleware/camunda/api.js](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Bananas/blob/main/app/frontend/server-middleware/camunda/api.js)

#### OpenAI API 

The OpenAI API is used to generate the job ad text automatically.

The implementaion of the OpenAI API is in [./app/frontend/server-middleware/ai/api.js](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Bananas/blob/main/app/frontend/server-middleware/ai/api.js). We use GPT-4 model via the ```createChatCompletion``` enpoint, which is included in the OpenAI JavaScript client. The prompt is the following:

```js
  const prompt = 'Please write a job ad with basic html formatting (allowd tags: h1, h2, ul, li, p). ' +
                 'The job ad should follow this format: Position Title, About Digisailors, Job Description, Requirements, Application. ' +
                 `The job ad is for the company "Digisailors" based in Olten and is for a position as "${req.body.title}". ` +
                 `The job add should include a section "About Digisailors" with the following text: "${about}". ` +
                 (skills ? `The job add should inlcude skills related to "${skills}" and extend to related and common skills for a "${req.body.title}". ` : '') +
                 'The applicants should apply online via "HR Buddy" on https://digisailors.ch/:'
```


#### Mastodon API

We simulate posting the job ad to Mastodon social media network (free, open source alternative to Twitter). This task is fully automated through a poller that connects to Camunda and waits for new tasks in the topic ```publish_social_media```. As soon as a new message (respectively: external task) is published on this topic, the automation grabs and locks the tasks, posts the tweet text against the Mastodon REST API and completes the external tasks (so that the token moves to the next stage of accepting candidate applications).

The implementation is in [./app/automation/entrypoint.js](https://github.com/DigiBP/Team-Bananas/blob/main/app/automation/entrypoint.js)

The Mastodon accounts with the tweets is to be found on [https://mstdn.social/@digisailors](https://mstdn.social/@digisailors)
