## Build Setup

You need to have a recent version of Node.js installed on your machine (tested on v14 LTS). However, there is a
Node.js docker container that already runs the application and you may not need to run the app directly via command
line.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev
```
